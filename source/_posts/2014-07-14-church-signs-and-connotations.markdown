I've lived my entire life in the "Bible Belt" of the United States. This swath
of the deep south gets its name from the fact that we have more churches than we
do grocery stores.  These churches often have a reader board out front, and the
church staff attempt to generate interest in the church by posting witty or
humorous statements:

Which is fine, right? I don't want to disparage these churches for attempting
to market themselves, and if nothing else they might entertain some folks on
their daily commute.

To make them readable from the road, these signs only have so much space for a
message, which means that those responsible for the signs have to be as concise
as possible with their message. This leads to clever quips like "Son screen
prevents sin burn," "You catch 'em, He cleans 'em," and "God wants you to be an
organ donor, give Him your heart." These messages are short and catchy, and are
designed to stick with you and color your thinking. The problem shows up when
you realize that these messages, as clever and catchy as they are, gloss over
some nuanced theological topics like
[salvation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation) and
[justification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justification_%28theology%29).
These satisfactory chunks of prose often prevent people from digging deeper and
thinking about the context surrounding these complicated ideas.

But this isn't a theology blog, it's a software development blog. So where am I
going with this?

The business world (and, to a somewhat lesser extent, the software development
world) is rife with these church sign sayings. Just like the pastors at those
churches, business and process pundits understand that catchy sayings and short
lists sell... and people eat it up.  We're surrounded by the platitudes and
bromides of our industry that ignore the nuance and complexity of what it is
we're trying to do.

One great example is the following quote, attributed to Henry Ford:

> If I’d asked my customers what they wanted, they’d have said a faster horse.

The central message here is that customers don't know what they want. You hear
this a lot in technical industries because it defends the idea that I, as a
technologically savvy engineer, know the needs of my illiterate customer base
better than they do. Why should I pay attention to what my customers are saying
when they're so woefully behind the times?

Setting aside whether Ford even said it in the first place, this quote
sidesteps a lot of the complexity involved in attempting to understand
your market, even in Ford's case (he may not have given his customers literally
what they would've wanted - a faster horse - but he did understand his market
well enough to know that they wanted a faster, affordable mode of
transportation).

Sometimes these church sign sayings appear as factoids rather than quotes. How
many of us have heard the following idea:

> It takes the average person 40 minutes to get back to work when they're interrupted.

The exact time seems to change based on who you ask, but this 
is a favorite saying among the "meetings are evil" crowd. If we've
accepted that interruptions have a huge negative impact on productivity, then
shouldn't we cut interruptions as much as possible?  Doesn't that mean
that any meeting is a bad meeting, since it interrupts everyone involved?

Well, maybe. What if this meeting could save you days of effort? What if the
interruptions/inefficiencies of dealing with this conversation in an email
thread instead of face-to-face are more disruptive than the meeting would have
been? There's a lot of context around any given meeting, and using the catchy
factoid as a method of dismissing all that context means that you often don't
make an informed decision.

These church sign sayings oversimplify your message and encourage people to
ignore the deeper context of the problems they're wrestling with. Next time you
have the urge to throw aphorisms around in a business discussion - regardless of
how clever they make you feel or how much you agree with them -
step back and think about whether you'd be helping your team deal with an
issue, or if you'd just be oversimplifying a hard problem.
