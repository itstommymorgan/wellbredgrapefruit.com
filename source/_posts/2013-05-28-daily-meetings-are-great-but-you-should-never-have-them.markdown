A staple of the "startup industry" is the daily standup meeting. The idea is
simple and the theory is effective: let's take time to make sure everyone is up
to speed on what everyone else is doing, and that management is in the know
about any potential problems. Typically these meetings follow a certain format:

- What got accomplished yesterday?
- What are you expecting to accomplish today?
- What problems are you (or your team) experiencing?

This is great information to share, because it keeps everyone well-informed and
provides a regular opportunity to share issues that management can fix or that
someone else on the team can provide a solution. Making this information share
part of the normal daily routine helps keep things moving.

Sounds great, right? Everybody should be doing this. Why do I say that you
should never have them, then?

__Because it's the _information_ that's great: the meetings are time-sinks.__

All meetings are terrible. I don't think this is news to anybody - meetings are
a necessary evil. They're often meandering, only sometimes productive, and they
always interrupt what each and every one of the meeting participants were
already doing (which, ostensibly, is what they're getting paid to do in the
first place).

Typically, people try to reconcile this fact with their need for a daily
meeting by trying to enforce a strict structure. "The meeting will only last 15
minutes," they say; "we won't actually discuss anything, go have discussions
after the meeting." Before long, arcane rules evolve about people with
stopwatches, and [pigs and chickens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig), and the daily meetings have taken on a life of their own.

The problem I have with this is that everyone is so bent on trying to minimize
the interruption factor for these meetings that they forget an important fact:
__the only benefit to having a meeting is the face-to-face discussion that it
allows for.__ Or, to put it another way: if you're structuring your meeting
around trying to eliminate anything that isn't a two-minute "this is what
I did/am doing/am having trouble with" update, _why are you having a meeting at
all?_

For the development team at Treehouse, we use a daily email thread to achieve
this, and it works great. I set up a cron job that fires an email on all of our
business days; the email reminds everybody to make sure that our task list is
up-to-date, to do a quick review of any new code that was submitted for the
site over the last day, and also asks the above three questions.

This is _so much better_ than actually having a meeting that I don't understand
why anybody would want to do anything else. Here are all the benefits:

- __The "standups" are automatically archived__: we use a Google Group for our
  dev-related conversations, and having everybody submit their updates via
  email means that we get a perfect archive of what everyone was up to for free.
- __The "standups" are minimally invasive__: because there's no meeting to
  schedule, there is no forced interruption. Everyone is just expected to
  respond to the email whenever they get to it in their morning routine (which,
  for a distributed team, means that we get responses throughout the day).
  Instead of dedicating 15 minutes every day for a meeting, everyone takes two
  minutes and writes an email. Reading the emails takes even less time, and
  instead of having to do it all at the same time they get to do it when they
  have a quick break to read their email.
- __The "standups" aren't hard__: there is no stopwatch. There are no pigs and
  chickens. There isn't an urge to verbally slap people on the wrist and tell
  them to take something "offline." If a discussion needs to happen, then it
  can happen as part of the email thread. Because you don't have to worry about
  whether or not people are observing the _structure_ of the meeting, you can
  focus instead on the conversation.  
  (A quick anecdote: I was actually in a situation where daily standup meetings were taking place, and the manager was focusing so much energy on trying to make sure everyone obeyed the rules and got through the meeting quickly, that he failed to notice that one of his team members had basically stalled for _two
  weeks_.)

Staying up to date is important, especially for a team/company that moves
quickly. But if you're moving that quickly, do you really have time to have
unnecessary meetings every day? Maybe give the email method a shot and see if
it works for your team. If it doesn't, or if you think there are some benefits
to having a daily face-to-face update, I'd love to hear about it.
