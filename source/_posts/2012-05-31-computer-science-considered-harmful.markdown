Are there really CS programs out there that focus on UML and Obj Z? I mean, we
covered UML, but it was a couple of days as part of another course.

A-freaking-men. Being a programmer is like being a writer - the more "real-world
experience" you have, the better your craft is.

Apprenticing as a developer isn't exactly a new idea, but... what are the
chances that our higher education system actually implements that?

Oh, and sorry about the title. [I couldn't resist][goto].
