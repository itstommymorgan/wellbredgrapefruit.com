I'm writing this post in reference to a tweet from [Chris Strom][cs]:

This is a pretty common mindset these days. As someone who works at
[Treehouse][treehouse], I obviously either agree that college is a horribly
inefficient way to prepare yourself to enter the workforce, or... well... I need
to find a new job. :) Treehouse bases its value on the idea that you can gain
all the skills you need to get a job in the tech sector - not by paying
thousands of dollars a year and spending four years taking classes, but by paying 
tens of dollars a month and learning what you want, when you want.

It seems like a no-brainer, right? The "higher education" system is a dying
leviathan that refuses to acknowledge its own mortality; much like newspapers,
phone books, and the once-burgeoning pager industry.

I think there is a nugget of truth to all of this, but it's not new and it's
definitely not a product of the internet age. That nugget is:

> If your aim is to become proficient in a specific profession, attending
> college for four years is one of the most inefficient ways to achieve that
> goal.

This is true for a number of reasons:

* Colleges are always behind the times on industry standards. This isn't really
  the fault of colleges or professors, it's just how it works. It takes time to
  learn about new techniques, realize their importance, update curriculums...
  and that assumes that the professors have the time and energy after fulfilling
  their other duties to keep a close eye on the industry.
* You're spending four years out of the workforce. Since you can't get
  up-to-date information on your industry (per the above bullet point), you've
  effectively delayed your real expertise-gathering experience by several years.
* There's a lot of stuff you _don't need_. None of those pesky graduate
  requirements apply directly to your field, but you still have to spend weeks
  (if not months) of your time learning about literature and history and
  philosophy.

So why do we pay tens of thousands of dollars to go to college? If it's such an
inefficient return on our investment and doesn't provide us with up-to-date
experience we can use to be a better entry-level employee, then why do companies
require us to have a degree before we can apply for employment?

College was never intended as a means of preparing ourselves to enter the
workforce; it was originally intended as a means of further preparing ourselves
to enter _humanity_. Much like teaching children things they may never find
practical in grade school - art, music, algebra, poetry - college was a guided
tour to broaden our horizons and allow us to gain a certain communion with the
greater history of western science and culture. It was an experience interesting
to few and one that fewer could take advantage of. If you were interested in
learning a trade, you didn't go to school - you apprenticed.

![What blog post is complete without an XKCD comic?](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/forgot_algebra.png)

Over the last fifty+ years that has changed - various programs (including the
grossly bloated student loan industry) encouraging attendance in college has
shifted the idea of college from being a luxury of those who had the money and
the desire to being almost as compulsory as grade school. Job recruiters turned
to the possession of a college degree as a quick and easy filter to cut down on
the number of applicants they needed to consider, which in turn drove up demand
for college education even further _and_ put pressure on colleges to impart
"useful" skills to their students. The whole mess very quickly descended to the
point where people who wouldn't have even considered college 60 years ago now
see it as a necessary (and horribly expensive) evil.

But in a lot of ways, a college education still retains a lot of its earlier
value - it's not great for training you to fill a certain position, to be sure,
but much like those music lessons you took in grade school it's a fantastic way
to expand your mind and expose yourself to new ideas and ways of thinking.

Does that mean that everyone should go to college? Of course not. Intellectual
pursuits like that aren't going to be valuable to everyone, and employers seem
to be coming around to the idea that a college degree isn't always a value-add
when it comes to the worth of a potential employee.

That said, I got a lot of value out of my college education. The technical
training I got in computer science hasn't had much of a direct impact on my
career, but I wouldn't be anywhere near the person I am today without the
general education I received. College may not have a lot of value for preparing
you to enter the workforce - which is why I believe so strongly in
[Treehouse][treehouse] and others like it - but that doesn't mean that it's
without value altogether.
