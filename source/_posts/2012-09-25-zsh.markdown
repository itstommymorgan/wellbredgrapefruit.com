I just spent the better part of an hour trying to figure this out, so I thought
I'd share.

[Pow][pow], ZSH, and [rbenv][rbenv] are all great tools in their own right, but
they really don't want to play well together. Despite all my attempts to the
contrary, pow refused to recognize my rbenv setup and tried to load up my Rails
application using the system (1.8) version of ruby.
<!-- more -->
[This issue][pow issue] in the Pow repository kind of illustrates how weird the issue is -
the history is littered with a bunch of different suggested fixes (and even
an allegation that Pow 0.4.0, which is the current version as of the time of
this blog post, will do away with the issue altogether... which it doesn't
appear to have done). After trying several different alternatives, this is the
one that finally worked for me:

1. Create a file named `.powconfig` in your home directory
2. Put the following in that file:
   ```
   export PATH=`brew --prefix rbenv`/shims:`brew --prefix rbenv`/bin:$PATH
   ```
3. Restart pow by running `touch ~/.pow/restart.txt`.

That immediately cleared up my problems and ended a rather frustrating search
for answers.
