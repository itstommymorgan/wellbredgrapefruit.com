### The Project Management Triangle

![The Project Management Triangle in Venn Diagram Form](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Project-triangle.svg/455px-Project-triangle.svg.png)

There's a popular concept in the world of software development: "good, fast, cheap: pick any two." Often visualized as a triangle, this model conveys
the inherent tradeoffs in working on complex projects:

* You can be fast and cheap, but it won't be high quality.
* You can be cheap and high quality, but it won't be fast.
* You can be fast and high quality, but it won't be cheap.

This is employed by software developers/project managers as a cautionary tale to clients and upper management who may be seeking to impose unrealistic constraints on a project:

* You can impose deadlines and budget restrictions, but then we can't make a quality product.
* You can impose budget restrictions and quality standards, but then we'll need more time.
* You can impose deadlines and quality standards, but then we'll need a lot more resources.

The problem I have with this metaphor is the "pick any two" part. For a project to be successful, leaving one of the three constraints out of the equation can be disastrous:

* If there's no pressure for a quality product, the product will be finished quickly and cheaply and not meet its goals.
* If there's no pressure for a cheap product, the costs of production can spiral out of control as the team ramps up to try to hit deadlines.
* If there's no pressure for a timely product, the project can drag on forever as the team chases perfection.

As snappy as the expression is, it doesn't seem to be the most effective way to think about constraints on a software project. It seems like all three constraints are necessary
for most projects to be successful - the thing that needs to be managed is the way the constraints relate to each other.

### Stoichiometry

Stoichiometry is a branch of chemistry that describes the relative relationship between reactants in chemical reactions. The most accessible version of stoichiometry is the
stoichiometry of combustion - the relationship between fuel, oxygen, and heat that allows for a fire (or explosion, if that's your thing) to happen.

All three elements - fuel, oxygen, and heat - must be present for ignition to happen. The interesting thing is that the presence of all three doesn't guarantee success. Too little heat
and there isn't enough energy to ignite the fuel. Too little oxygen and there isn't enough for the fuel to react with. Too little fuel and you'll never generate a spark.

The relationship varies depending on the circumstances of the reaction. Most fuels operate over a range - they'll ignite, say, at a 1-in-20 ratio with normal air and at a 1-in-10 ratio, but they'll burn more
effectively and efficiently at a 1-in-15 ratio. Varying the temperature and scale of your heat source can cause a slow burn or create a massive explosion.

### Stoichiometry and Software Projects

Much like a software project, combustion has three chief constraints: fuel, oxygen, and heat stand in as a metaphor for good, fast, and cheap. The difference is that when we think about successfully
burning fuel, we think about it as a balancing act - we try to bring our three constraints together in a way that ensures success, maximizes efficiency, and reduces waste. When we think about constraints
in terms of successful software projects, we tend to think about them defensively: we tell our clients that they'll just have to wait if they want a quality product, and that we can hit their deadline if
they're willing to hire another contractor. When management is upset about how long this project is taking, we quote the "iron triangle" and ask them to pick which two things they'd like to encourage.

But the truth is that a successful software project is a lot like a successful fire - you need all three constraints to be present in order to succeed. At
some point you have to limit the scope and dissuade perfectionism, or your product will never launch. You have to set some kind of deadline and work towards it, or your clients will grow impatient and
management will lose faith in your progress. You have to be concerned about costs, or you'll find yourself out of money (and a job) before your project can be put to use.

Good. Fast. Cheap. Pick all three, but balance them carefully.
