I've officially been managing the development team at Treehouse since last
December or so, which puts me near my six-month mark here in May. During that
time, I've been trying to come up with a good management style: I've been
exposed to a lot of different management techniques and attitudes, ranging from
deplorable, to annoying-but-useful, to fantastic over the course of my career
thus far. Now that management is a key component of my day-to-day
responsibilities, it's important for me to have a good management philosophy in
much the same way as it's important to have a good coding philosophy: thinking
through a lot of this stuff up front will help me to be more consistent and
decisive when I'm faced with an issue.

One sort of mantra I've developed - and the other developers at Treehouse can
attest to this, as they're probably already tired of hearing it - is "Manage up,
and down, but not sideways." It's a simple way to remind myself of where my
responsibilities should lie. Here's what it means if you break it down:

## Managing Up

!["Dilbert comic strip, 12/05/2010"](http://dilbert.com/dyn/str_strip/000000000/00000000/0000000/100000/00000/7000/100/107169/107169.strip.sunday.gif)

### What this means:

"Managing up" is the act of managing the leadership team in your company as it
relates to your team and the work your team is doing. Specifically, it involves
the following:

* **Representing your team to leadership**: if any other member of leadership
  has a question about what the dev team is working on, or why we're executing
  on our tasks in a certain way, or anything like that, they should be able to
  get that information from me. If anybody else on the team needs to be bothered
  for answers, then they're getting pulled off of whatever they're working on,
  which isn't good. This also involves making your team look good; not in the
  sense of hiding failures, but in terms of actively promoting successes.
* **Advocating for your team to leadership**: if there's anything about the way
  Treehouse works, as a company, that causes any sort of inconvenience or
  hardship for my team, I need to be bringing that up as long as there's a
  possibility it can be resolved by leadership.
* **Managing expectations for your team with leadership**: Making sure that
  everyone is on-board with what your team is doing and when/how their tasks are
  going to be completed is important; not only does it help ensure that your
  team's focus is in the right place, but it also keeps leadership informed
  enough to make responsible decisions when strategic decisions need to be made.

### Why this is a good thing:

For lack of a better way to put it, if you manage up properly then your team
doesn't have to worry about leadership being on their backs. Managing up
properly effectively means that you've created a barrier between your team and
the leadership level, and by acting as a go-between you can help your team stay
on-task and productive.

## Managing Down

### What this means:

"Managing down" is the act of managing the careers of the individual members of
your team. Specifically, it involves the following:

* **Managing the workload of your team members**: making sure that everyone is
  working on the appropriate tasks and is cognizant of any deadlines or other
  pressures that might affect those tasks. This is what most people think of
  when they traditionally think of "management."
* **Improving the career of your team members**: making sure that on top of
  everything else, your employees are building a better career for themselves.
  This can take several forms, from making sure that they're happy with their
  job to actively working with them to improve or add to their skills.
* **Communicating with your team members**: if you're managing up properly, then
  your team often isn't included in a lot of the conversation that happens at
  the leadership level - which is good, because a lot of that conversation isn't
  very useful to your team; it can be a lot of back-and-forth about ideas
  that will never come close to being implemented. But there is a lot of
  valuable information that you will need to convey to the rest of your team -
  filtering the useful stuff from the distracting stuff and disseminating that
  to your team is a very important part of the job description. Beyond that,
  you'll also need to be sure to communicate clearly on any decisions that you
  have to make, and make sure that your team is communicating well within
  itself.

### Why this is a good thing:

When you get a job as a manager, this is what people are expecting you to do -
manage your direct reports. By making sure that your team is working on the
right stuff, is focused on self-improvement, and are on the same page with
leadership about the company's direction and vision, you're building a team that
will execute effectively and efficiently.

## Managing Sideways

!["Dilbert comic strip, 12/07/1998"](http://dilbert.com/dyn/str_strip/000000000/00000000/0000000/000000/10000/2000/900/12961/12961.strip.gif)

### What this means:

"Managing sideways" is the act of setting yourself up as a go-between between
your team and the rest of the company. It means that all communications go
through (or otherwise include) you, and that you put yourself in a position to
"approve" work before it's finished. 

### Why this is a bad thing:

Aside from the obvious observation that you're generating a lot more work for
yourself by managing sideways, you're also at least implicitly saying that you
don't trust your team to do their jobs. This is a problem for everyone in the
company - it's a problem for your employees, because without freedom to act
without oversight they'll never grow in their careers. It's a problem for you,
because you'll never be able to truly delegate any tasks. And it's a problem for
the company at large, because now all the work that gets done by your team has
one overloaded point of failure: you.

So I constantly try to remind myself to manage up, and down, but never sideways.
I've encouraged everyone on my team to call me out if I ever seem to be
inserting myself between them and their work, and hopefully they'll honor that -
the temptation is pretty strong to try to control everything, and although I
feel like I've been getting better about it I'm sure there are still times that
I try to get too involved in specific tasks for my team. I still think that
there's a lot of value in the other two "directions" of management, though, and
try to practice those as zealously as I am able.

Is this a good way to look at the task of management? So far it seems to be for
me, but I'm still relatively new to the trade. We'll see how it works out as
time goes on, I suppose.
