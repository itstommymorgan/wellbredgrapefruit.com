Far too often in our industry, people climb to the top of their blogs and shout
to the rest of the world: "You're doing it wrong! I'm doing it right! Maybe if
you were more like me, you'd be more successful. Maybe if you were more like me,
I'd consider you to be a *real* programmer. Maybe if you were more like me, I'd
want to work with you, and I wouldn't shudder in the very depths of my soul
every time I looked at your code."

And I know. I do it too, sometimes. But I want to make up for it. Here's a brief
list of some things I know I'm doing wrong:

- I don't write tests first as often as I should.
- I regularly make changes/bugfixes in code without taking a few minutes to make
  the surrounding code any better.
- I break code out into new objects when I shouldn't, and I pile methods onto
  existing objects when they should be split into their own class.
- I regularly succumb to the pressure of my todo list, and let myself push quick
  fixes out the door when I feel overwhelmed.
- I often care more about how the code looks to me than about how it works for
  the customer.
- I sometimes approach problems with a "we can't do that" attitude instead of
  approaching it from the "how can we make this work?" angle.

Everybody makes mistakes, and everyone has pet problems they're working on.
Maybe we should be less worried about telling every other developer how to do
their job, and focus more on sharing what we've learned about our own habits?
