### About Me
<img alt="Yeah, that's me." src="/images/tommy.jpg" class="floatL" style="margin-right:10px;"/>
I'm Tommy Morgan, and I'm a developer at [Treehouse][treehouse]. I graduated from
[Furman University][furman] with a degree in Computer Science back in '06, and I've been
doing software development ever since. [Ruby][ruby] is my current passion, but I've
spent extensive time with several other languages and am always interested in
dabbling with something new.

I use this blog to post my thoughts on software development, project management,
and anything relevant to the two.

### About The Well-Bred Grapefruit
Llewelyn, my personal mascot (the impressively-groomed citrus in the header up
there) came to me in a fit of insanity inspired by a [Douglas Adams quote][gfquote].
He classes up the joint, so I let him stick around.
